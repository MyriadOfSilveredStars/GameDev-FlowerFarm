# GameDev-FlowerFarm
Repository for my Mobile Game Development module. Coding has not yet begun, so this will update when the project starts

Planned Features:
- Play area to resemble a quaint farm valley
- Can interact with crop fields to grow flowers
- Grow different flowers per season
- Harvest flowers and create bouquets
- Sell the bouquets for money to buy more seeds
- Each season, create one bespoke bouquet and give to your wife (NPC)
- Once bouquet is gifted, change seasons
- End in winter

Hopeful Features:
- Some flowers turn into monsters
- Kill monsters to get Blood Flowers
- Create bouquets from Blood Flowers
- Gifting Blood Bouquet each season unlocks different ending
- Have a dog to attack the monsters for you
